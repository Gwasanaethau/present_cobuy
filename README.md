Project Outline (as understood by the team before talking to client)
===============

As a caring and efficient friend
So that I can co-buy presents with other people
I want an app that automatically buys presents once everybody's paid in

As a finance-aware buyer
So that I can only make a purchase when all funds are received
I want to be notified when we reach our target

As a good friend
So that I can cover part of the cost of a present for my friend
I want to add an arbitrary sum to the pool

===============
Questions for the client
===============
* Is the cost split evenly or is the contribution amount arbitrary?
* Final payment options: use Zinc.io or trust one of the group with the money?
